basicBot-customization
======================
Click [here](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot) for basicBot's main repository.

Using custom room settings or adding functionality is done by loading your own script loading and modifying the bot.
This repository's purpose is to facilitate this. You can fork the repository and customise [the example script](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot-customization/blob/master/extension.js). 
When you have forked the repo, bookmark the following script, __but change _Yemasthui_ to your own github handle__. 

`javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/RobinGall2910/AsylumBot-customization/master/extension.js');})();`

If you are using your own hosting service for your script, swap the link with your own.

A detailed overview of the possible settings can be found [here](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot-customization/blob/master/settingsOverview.md).

(A custom .json file can still be used for custom file settings, but is discouraged as the method provided here allows for more customization.)
